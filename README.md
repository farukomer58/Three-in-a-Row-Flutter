## Overview

Three-in-a-Row is a two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to achieve three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game and tap "Start Game" on the home screen.
2. Players take turns tapping empty cells in the grid to mark them with their respective symbols.
3. The first player to successfully mark three cells in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Winning

To win the game, a player must get three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row. This can be achieved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once a player accomplishes this, a dialog will appear announcing the winner and providing options to restart the game or return to the main menu.

## Tie Game

If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie. In this case, a dialog will appear announcing the tie and offering the player the choice to restart the game or return to the main menu.
